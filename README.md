## Description
This application is a social network api designed to allow users to share their thoughts, react to friends thoughts and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, Nodemon for development assistance, a MongoDB database and the Mongoose ODM. It also utilizes the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps. 


## Installation
To install this application, create a directory in which you will develop your application. Inititalize a `package.json` file by running `npm init -y`. You can then set up your git repo by running `git init` and creating a `.gitignore` file. After ensuring your `package.json` contains all required dependencies, install them by running `npm install` in your root directory. You should see your `node_modules` folder populate in your root directory.

## Usage
To use this application, make sure you have followed all installation instructions and installed the required dependencies. To start the server and run this program, enter `npm start` in your terminal. Alternatively, if you wish restart the server with Nodemon during development and testing, start the server by running the command `npm run dev` in your terminal. Once the server is live, you will be able to use an API tester such as Insomnia or Postman to test the CRUD functionality of your API.
